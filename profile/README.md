# Cloud Lada

This organisation contains all code used to track our trip to Mongolia for the 2023 [Mongol Rally](https://www.theadventurists.com/adventures/mongol-rally/).

The Mongol rally is a yearly trip where teams travel 10,000 miles from Prague to Mongolia in completely unsuitable vehicles with no set route. For our team,
we opted to drive a 1988 [Lada 2107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada_Riva) (purchased in Portugal), spending approximately 18 months getting
it road-worthy.

As an additional challenge, we wanted to provide our concerned friends and family a simple place to track our trip based on telemetry data pulled
from the car itself, so this organisation was created to preserve the software we build to do so.
